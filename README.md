Here is my redux learning lesson A to Z.

Some working principle of React Redux or (global state manager)
/**
 1. State Name //must be neede
 2. Redux Action
    1.Type //must needed why redux work based on this type;
    2.Payload
 3.Store
    1.getState(); //for get the current state
    2.dispatch(); //for action 
    3.subscribe(); //for console log
**/
